# TimeIntegratedSpeckle_KL

This repository contains code that I have written to simulate statistically accurate 2D time-integrated dynamic speckle patterns in biomedical optics: a previously unsolved problem. 

This has been published in Optics Letters (https://opg.optica.org/ol/abstract.cfm?uri=ol-46-17-4390) and in my Phd thesis (https://discovery.ucl.ac.uk/id/eprint/10149090/). I was also invited to present this research at SPIE BiOS 2022 (https://www.spiedigitallibrary.org/conference-proceedings-of-spie/PC11959/2603939/Simulation-of-statistically-accurate-time-integrated-dynamic-speckle-patterns-in/10.1117/12.2603939.full), and I also presented this work at IEE IPC 2021, where I was nominated for best student paper (https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/9592981).
