# TimeIntegratedSpeckle_KL

This repository contains code that I have written to simulate statistically accurate 2D time-integrated dynamic speckle patterns in biomedical optics: a previously unsolved problem. 

This has been published in [Optics Letters](https://opg.optica.org/ol/abstract.cfm?uri=ol-46-17-4390) and in my [Phd thesis](https://discovery.ucl.ac.uk/id/eprint/10149090/). I was also invited to present this research at [SPIE BiOS 2022](https://www.spiedigitallibrary.org/conference-proceedings-of-spie/PC11959/2603939/Simulation-of-statistically-accurate-time-integrated-dynamic-speckle-patterns-in/10.1117/12.2603939.full), and I also presented this work at [IEE IPC 2021](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/9592981), where I was nominated for best student paper.

Script titles of the scripts in the main directory are self-explanatory, referring to either the Figure number in the Optics Letters paper or to work presented at SPIE BiOS 2022. Please note data dependencies and data that need to be generated for each script. Please also note that for Figure 4 of the Optics Letters paper I have used MATLAB's inbuilt phantom function to generate the seed image, but you are free to use whatever image you wish. 

I have made this code open source in the hope that others may use and/or extend this research. If you use this code in your research, please make the following citations
